# Pending Booking Status Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete pending booking workflow where new hotel bookings now start with "pending" status, requiring partner approval before confirmation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Booking Creation API (`/api/bookings/route.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: New bookings were automatically set to "confirmed" status
- **AFTER**: New bookings now default to "pending" status
- Partners must explicitly confirm or reject pending bookings

### 2. Booking Model (`/models/Booking.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Limited status enum without pending
- **AFTER**: Added "pending" as first option in status enum
- Set "pending" as the default status for new bookings
- Added all missing fields referenced by frontend components

### 3. User Booking Interface (`/app/(dashboard)/account/bookings/page.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: No pending status handling
- **AFTER**: Complete pending status integration
- Added "Pending" tab in booking filters
- Updated status badge styling for pending bookings
- Added pending stats tracking
- Updated filtering logic to handle pending bookings

### 4. Partner Booking Interface (`/app/(dashboard)/partner/bookings/page.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: Basic booking management
- **AFTER**: Enhanced pending booking management
- Prominent pending booking counts in stats cards
- Clear pending status highlighting
- Action buttons specifically for pending bookings (Confirm/Reject)

### 5. API Improvements
- **Partner Bookings API**: Enhanced data transformation for better frontend integration
- **User Bookings API**: Added pending stats and improved data structure
- **Status Update API**: Already functional from previous fix, now supports pending workflow

## User Experience Flow

### For Customers (Users)
1. **Book Hotel**: User makes a hotel booking
2. **Pending Status**: Booking shows as "pending" status
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: User sees "Pending" tab and can track status
4. **Status Updates**: User can refresh to see when partner confirms/rejects

### For Hotel Partners
1. **Notification**: Pending bookings show prominently in stats
2. **Review Booking**: Partner can see all booking details
3. **Take Action**: Partner can confirm or reject the booking
4. **Status Change**: Booking status updates in real-time

## Technical Implementation

### Status Workflow
```
User Books Hotel
      ↓
  [PENDING] ← Initial status
      ↓
Partner Reviews
      ↓
   Confirm?
   /      \
[CONFIRMED] [CANCELLED]
    ↓          ↓
[COMPLETED] [CANCELLED]
```

### Database Schema
- `status` enum: `['pending', 'confirmed', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'upcoming']`
- Default status: `'pending'`
- All booking fields properly mapped between APIs and frontend

### UI Components
- **Pending Badge**: Secondary variant for visual distinction
- **Stats Cards**: Show pending counts prominently
- **Filtering**: Dedicated pending tab in both user and partner interfaces
- **Actions**: Context-specific action buttons based on status

## Benefits

2. **Fraud Prevention**: Ability to reject suspicious bookings
3. **Capacity Management**: Partners can confirm based on availability
4. **Customer Communication**: Clear status tracking for customers

### Technical Benefits
1. **Data Consistency**: Proper status workflow throughout the system
2. **Real-time Updates**: Status changes reflect immediately
3. **Better UX**: Clear visual indicators for different booking states
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Clean separation between user and partner workflows
