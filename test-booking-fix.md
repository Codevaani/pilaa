# Booking Status Update Fix - Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed
The partner booking status updates were not being reflected on the user side because the API was only returning mock responses without actually updating the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Partner Booking Update API (`/api/partner/bookings/[id]/route.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Mock API that only returned success without updating database
- **AFTER**: Full database integration with authentication, authorization, and actual booking status updates

### 2. Booking Model (`/models/Booking.ts`)
- **BEFORE**: Limited schema with missing fields referenced in frontend
- **AFTER**: Complete schema with all fields used by frontend components

### 3. User Bookings Page (`/app/(dashboard)/account/bookings/page.tsx`)
- **BEFORE**: No way to refresh bookings after status changes
- **AFTER**: Added refresh button with loading states for manual updates

### 4. API Data Transformation
- **Partner API**: Now returns complete booking data with proper field mapping
- **User API**: Enhanced data transformation to ensure consistent field structure

## Testing Steps

### Prerequisites
1. Have a partner account with properties
2. Have user bookings for those properties
3. Access to both partner panel and user dashboard

### Test Procedure

#### Step 1: Verify Initial State
1. Login as partner
2. Go to Partner Dashboard → Bookings
3. Note current status of a booking
4. Login as user (or switch accounts)
5. Go to Account → My Bookings
6. Verify the same booking shows the same status

#### Step 2: Update Status in Partner Panel
1. Return to partner panel
2. Go to Bookings section
3. Find a booking with "pending" or "confirmed" status
4. Click on action button (confirm/reject/complete)
5. Verify the UI updates locally

#### Step 3: Verify User Side Update
1. Switch to user account
2. Go to My Bookings
3. Click the "Refresh" button (new feature)
4. Verify the booking status has been updated
5. Check that stats cards reflect the change

#### Step 4: Test Different Status Transitions
- Confirm a pending booking
- Complete a confirmed booking  
- Cancel a booking
- Verify each change reflects properly on user side

### Expected Results
✅ Status changes in partner panel persist to database
✅ User bookings page shows updated status after refresh
✅ Booking stats update correctly
✅ No console errors during status updates
✅ Proper authorization (partners can only update their property bookings)

### Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Ensure proper user authentication
4. Check partner has ownership of properties with bookings
